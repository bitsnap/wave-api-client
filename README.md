### [Wave](https://www.waveapps.com/) API Client

[Bitsnap](https://bitsnap.io) Operational Intelligence Platform [Wave](https://www.waveapps.com/) API client package.

Existing accounting platforms often suffer from reliability issues, such as potential ledger data loss and inconsistent API specifications, 
making long-term use and interoperability risky. To address these challenges, Yuriy is publishing up-to-date Accounting Services API Clients with a focus on long-term support. 
These clients aim to uncover and highlight inconsistencies in API specifications and documentation.

Bitsnap focuses on importing and data processing, instead of synchronization.

## Refactoring

NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION USE.

# Add the following to ~/.bashrc:
echo '. "$HOME/.asdf/asdf.sh"' >> ~/.bashrc
# Completions must be configured by adding the following to your .bashrc:
echo '. "$HOME/.asdf/completions/asdf.bash"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

```bash
# install asdf

asdf plugin add golang
asdf plugin add golangci-lint 
asdf plugin add ko
asdf plugin add goreleaser

go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports@latest
go install mvdan.cc/gofumpt@latest
go install github.com/onsi/ginkgo/v2/ginkgo@latest
```

### Code generation

# will scrape the existing API documentation pages and emit the respective API client methods
# enums and models validation, where applicable

go generate ./...
```
